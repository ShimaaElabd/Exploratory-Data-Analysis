# Explore and Summerize Dataset of (Red Wines)

In this project, I have used R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques and explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

# Reflection

When working with such a dataset the first challenge is to choose which variable to explore and find itâ€™s relation with other variables 
but luckily, the dataset already hints at some variables of interest.
it tells us that citric acid can add freshness to wines, while acetic acid can add an unpleasant vinegar taste.
This shows how important it is to have specific domain knowledge while performing a data analysis.
and When we do not have that domain knowledge, consulting with an expert in the field will be incredibly valuable to save time.

My Second challenge was making visualization for more than two variables as it became harder to grasp conclusions but it came up with good results thogh.

As Fusture work in this project, I could think of Use also the white wines dataset to see if we can come up with the same conclusions or it wil be different.

And as a next step I will develop a machine learning model to predict the red wine quality based on this variables of interest.
